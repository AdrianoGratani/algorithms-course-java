## Useful Informations ##

Every single code is inside the ./Algorithms-DS-in-Java-explained-main folder of this repository.

This README.md file contains no description/explanation of the code. Please open a specific Java file to read the code analysis in the comment section.
I coded each algorithm using Nano editor, and then I created Java packages, this code works well on EclipseIDE.

To learn Algorithms I followed a 50-hours course available on Youtube, made by Dinesh Varjiany, a Software Engineer at Google.
I didn't follow his instructions: at the beginning of the lessons Dinesh sets the task and describes the algorithms, then I tried to figure it out, all by myself, each implementation
for the algorithm.

I can state that by following this "active learning" approach, my skills at programming, and at finding recurring patterns over different programming fields, consistently increased.
